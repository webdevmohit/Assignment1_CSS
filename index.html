	<h1>CSS Can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>
	<ul class="ul-spc">
		<li>
			Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1
		</li>
		<li>
			Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section
		</li>
		<li>
			External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file
		</li>
		<li>
			The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however, 
			<span class="st2">in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself
		</li>

	<p class="st3">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</p>

	<p class="st4">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>

	<p class="st5">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
